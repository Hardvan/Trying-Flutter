# Trying Flutter

This project is a result of experimenting with Flutter based on a [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/1xipg02Wu8s?si=djny2mjWuSmrprSc) by Fireship.

## Steps Taken

1. **Material App**: Set up the basic MaterialApp structure for the Flutter project.
2. **Container**: Utilized the Container widget for layout and styling within the Flutter app.
3. **Flex Layout**: Implemented a flexible layout using the Flex widget.
4. **Stack**: Explored the use of the Stack widget for positioning elements on top of each other.
5. **Scaffold Magic**:: Leveraged the power of the Scaffold widget for creating the app's basic structure.
6. **List View**:: Incorporated a ListView to display a scrollable list of items.
7. **Builder**:: Used the Builder widget to obtain a new BuildContext for proper navigation.
8. **Stateful Widget**:: Introduced a StatefulWidget to manage and update the app's state.
9. **Navigator**:: Implemented navigation between screens using the Navigator widget.
